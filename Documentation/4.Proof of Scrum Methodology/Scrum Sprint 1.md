# Sprint Retrospective Reports

## Sprint 1 Retrospective Report:

### What Went Well:
- Effective collaboration among team members.
- Successful implementation of the user role and permission management feature.
- Timely completion of application submission and tracking features.
- Overachieved by completing dashboards for the next sprint for User, Manager, and Admin:
  - Admin's dashboard allows promotion and demotion of users.
  - Enables changing of access and permissions.
- Team members found using GitHub collaboratively to be slightly challenging.

### What Could Be Improved:
- Need for better estimation of task efforts.
- Improve communication with the client for clearer requirements.

### Insights:
- Choice of database didn't fit our needs and experience.
- Firebase allowed easy Google sign-in and sign-up, but was more difficult to use compared to SQL.
- Opted to use Firebase for security and SQL for daily usage.
- Initially, team members insisted on using plain HTML and CSS, but found it easier to switch to Node.
- Tasks for the coming sprint assigned based on strengths: Zahra and Nthabi on front end, and Anist and Thabiso on backend, with Amaan bridging the logic by doing both.
- Muhammed, while capable at front and backend, ended up doing the majority of documentation for convenience.
- Trend likely to continue.


### Action Items for Next Sprint:
- Refine task estimation process.
- Schedule regular check-ins with the client for requirement clarifications.
