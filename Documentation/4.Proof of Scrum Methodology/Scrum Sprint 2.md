## Sprint Retrospective Reports

### Sprint 2 Retrospective Report:

#### What Went Well:
- Most of the tasks completed.
- Almost everything works to expectation
- Effective collaboration among team members.
- Successful implementation of the review and approval workflow for fund managers.
- Timely completion of application submission and status tracking features.
- Overachieved by completing dashboards for the next sprint for User, Manager, and Admin:
  - Admin's dashboard allows promotion and demotion of users.
  - Enables changing of access and permissions.

#### What Could Be Improved:
- Unintended behaviour of certain pages to be fixed, tracked in notion as backlog for next sprint.
- Some tasks were not completed on time.
- Need for better estimation of task efforts.
- Improve communication with the client for clearer requirements.
- Improve testing % for future

#### Insights:
- Test cases still not fully implemented. Implementing Circle CI and using testing like JEst was found to be cumbersome. This sprint was mainly an issue was testing but all tasks assigned were completed. 

#### Action Items for Next Sprint:
- Refine task estimation process.
- Schedule regular check-ins with the client for requirement clarifications.
